This repository contains the complete code for the entire task. I structured it according to the recommended guidelines, organizing it into directories such as Dashboard and pages. The pages folder includes all the code related to analyzing user experience, satisfaction, and user engagement, with each analysis presented separately. Finally, I created app.py as a dashboard to showcase the results of the analyses from each page.
